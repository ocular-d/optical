How to use chapter and sections to structure documents.

</TLDR>

## Chapter

Use chapters to break up the document into smaller chunks.
A chapter break should occur when a major subject change happens.

## Sections

Use sections within the chapter when the subject changes, but you are still discussing a particular aspect of a larger subject.
