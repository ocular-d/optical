## Accessibility terms

Don’t use language that defines people by their disability, such as disabled, impaired, and the deaf.
A person might have a visual impairment, but that person isn’t impaired.

## Bias-free communication

Use gender-neutral alternatives for common terms.

- Rewrite to use the second person (you).
- Rewrite the sentence to have a plural noun and pronoun.
- Use the or a instead of a pronoun (for example, "the document").
- Refer to a person's role (reader, employee, customer, or client, for example).
- Use person or individual.

**When you're writing about a real person, use the pronouns that person prefers,** whether it's *he, she, they,*
or another pronoun.
It's OK to use gendered pronouns (like *he, she, his,* and *hers*) when you're
writing about real people who use those pronouns themselves.

It's also OK to use gendered pronouns in content such as direct quotations and the titles of works and when gender
is relevant, such as discussions about the challenges that women face in the workplace.

:::caution

**Don't make generalizations about people, countries, regions, and cultures,** not even positive or neutral generalizations.

**Don't use slang,** especially if it could be considered cultural appropriation, such as *spirit animal.*

**Don't use profane or derogatory terms,** such as *pimp* or *bitch.*

**Avoid culturally sensitive terms,** such as the terms associated with military or political actions or other historic events and eras.

:::

**Focus on people, not disabilities.**

For example, talk about readers who are blind or have low vision and customers with limited dexterity.
Don't use words that imply pity, such as *stricken with* or *suffering from.*
Don't mention a disability unless it's relevant.

## Alt text

[Alt text is an essential accessibility tool](https://aceseditors.org/news/2020/how-to-write-great-alt-text-and-why-it-matters) for users with visual impairments.
It's a piece of text that explains the subject of an hyperlink or image so that screen readers can read it to users.

It ensures that those readers get the same benefit from photos, charts, and other visuals that fully sighted readers get.

### Usability tips

- Include alt text for links and images
- Add an [empty alt text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/ "Documentation about decorative images on W3C") for decorative images
- Describe the content of the image instead of using the generic term "image". For example, "Screenshot of" or "Diagram of"
- Keep alt text to a maximum of 10-15 words
- If an image is so complicated that requires more than a short description to provide value to readers,
consider providing a link to an explanatory text
- Do not editorialize alt text.
It should not include assumptions or interpretations of the image or describe subjects’ intentions
- Make sure the description of the page's content is accurate to avoid [pogo sticking](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/pogo-sticking/ "Article about pogo sticking on NNGroup")
- Avoid using "link" as most screen readers already add that word
- [Avoid duplicate links](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/duplicate-links/ "Article about duplicate links on NNGroup") in the same article unless the links are very apart from each other.
  - Unless it's a glossary file
  - Unless it's email addresses (Although an article with duplicate email addresses could be rewritten!)

### Style tips

- Avoid Saxon Genitive "'s" - For example "Acmecorp's website"
- Use consistent terminology when referring to content.
For example, don't mix "Article about $" with "Chapter about $"
- Follow the capitalization of proper names. For example, write "iOS" not "iOs", "venv" not "VENV"
- Use official names. If the website is called, "Acme Help" don't call it "Acme Support Center"
- Use sentence case throughout the text unless the first word is a proper noun that is lower caps
- Don't write "Home Page", write "website". For example, "Acme website"

## Use short and clear sentences

Use words with precise meanings, and remove words that don’t add substance.

Use your judgment to avoid sounding abrupt or unfriendly.

Choose simple verbs without modifiers. Whenever you can, avoid weak or vague verbs, such as *be*, *have*, *make*, and *do*.

| :thumbsup: Use this | :thumbsdown: Not this             |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| use                 | utilize, make use of              |
| remove              | extract, take away, eliminate     |
| tell                | inform, let know                  |

Don’t use two or three words when one will do.

| :thumbsup: Use this | :thumbsdown: Not this             |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| to                  | in order to, as a means to        |
| also                | in addition                       |
| connect             | establish connectivity            |

Whenever possible, choose words that have one clear meaning.

| :thumbsup: Use this                                | :thumbsdown: Not this                             |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
|*Because* you created the table, you can change it. | *Since* you created the table, you can change it. |

Omit unnecessary adverbs—words that describe how, when,or where.
Unless they're important to the meaning of a statement, leave them out.

### Examples

- Quite
- Very
- Quickly
- Easily
- Effectively

Use one term consistently to represent one concept.

Use words that can be both nouns and verbs carefully—file, post, mark, screen, record, and report, for example.
Use the sentence structure and context to eliminate ambiguity.
